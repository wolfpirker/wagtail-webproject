This Wagtail webpage project was created with the intention of 
thinking of the feasibility of creating a travel guide webpage
for my friends brother in Cambodia; and also just for Wagtail 
and Django learning purposes.

Development started in second half of 2019 and became stuck in 2020. 
I lost interest partly, because it is a bit too huge project, 
it was development just for free, without fixed intention of earning money. 
Another reason was the tourism slowdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

Apart from Wagtail, this project also uses following technlogies:
* Bulma CSS framework
* Vue.js -> vuelendar for Calendar functionality

The project was started on wagtail/bakerydemo and 
then  adapted and extended. 
Some code snippets still originate from this project. 

A recent webpage of that project can be found here:

A older version, without Bulma can be found here, without any images:
